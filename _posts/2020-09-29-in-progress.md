I have several ideas I'm currently working on all building up to diving into the player data from RPGLite, [our little game](rpglite.app). Sorry it's taking me a while. I want to talk about cyclical balance (everyone is better than atleast one person and worse than at least one) and orthogonal unit differentiation (everyone doesn't something different) before I describe the thinking behind the design for RPGLite and what we actually saw happen.
