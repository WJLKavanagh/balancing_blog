o/ All,

I'm William, and this is my website.

I'm William Kavanagh, a Computer Science Ph.D. supervised by [Dr Alice Miller](https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/computing/staff/alicemiller/) student at the University of Glasgow in the Formal Methods, Theory and Algorithms group. For my research I am looking at making games fun using novel techniques. Outside of work I am player of games.

You're all going to have to be patient with me, because I'm a dumb idiot, meanwhile here are links to some pages so I can make this place gorgeous...
[link 1](/hidden_area_lol_1/),
[link 2](/hidden_area_lol_2/),
[link 3](/hidden_area_lol_3/).

Soon, you'll have your #content, I promise.
